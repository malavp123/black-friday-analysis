## Recommendations/ Next Steps:

### Products:
1. Categories 1, 5, and 8 consistently outperform others across all locations in both quantity and purchase amount. We should focus on promoting these products at underperforming locations to boost revenue.
2. Categories 5 and 8 generate nearly half of the total sales despite being sold in similar quantities as category 1. This suggests an opportunity to revisit the pricing strategy for category 1 to maximize its profitability.3
3. Review stock levels for underperforming products (9, 12, 13, 17, 19, and 20) to minimize unsold inventory and reduce losses. Investigate whether competition or other factors are affecting their sales.

### Buyers:
1. Analyze buyer behavior at Location B, where fewer customers generate the highest total sales. Engaging these buyers with personalized offers could foster loyalty and create a steady revenue stream.
2. Our sale attracted Male Buyers the most across all the 3 locations (More than 75%), especially ages 26-45. Should we introduce products or discounts targeted to these buyers?
3. About 35% of the population consists of people who have recently moved to the city (within the last year), and they have contributed the most to total sales. Identifying their specific needs and introducing relevant products could unlock further revenue opportunities.
